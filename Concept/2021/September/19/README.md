# ScreenTeX concept

## 2021 September 19th

ScreenTeX is a tool that grabs all text when taking a screenshot rather than getting an image.

Rich text and formatting options will be included.

Exporting as TXT, MD, PY, Java, C, C++, CSV, C#, JavaScript, Kotlin, etc. is allowed.

Add alias: ALT + P + F10 to separate from actual screenshots.

Option to save data in a different format after each screenshot, default is TXT.

# Troubleshooting

## How ScreenTeX works

The project does not use a special algorithm to read the image and export the text, it just copies everything from the background and puts it into a file.

## The program is not working

Please avoid all other troubleshooting advice for now, as the program is not functional yet.

## Text is not exporting

If this is not possible in some cases due to DRM or other system failures, you will likely just need to stop using that software/website, wait for your computer to become stable again, or fix your computer. In the meantime, you can always get a picture with a separate camera if you have one, although it will be of lower quality and hard to make out (and won't copy the text)

## Where is the data being put

On Linux, data is automatically placed in your `home` directory, located at `///<username>/home/` although you can change it to any location you want (this feature is currently a request)

On Windows NT, data is placed in your `documents` directory, located at `///C/users/<username>/Documents/` although you can change it to any location you want, except for system folders, such as `system32` and `SYSWOW64` (this feature is currently a request)

On MacOS, data is placed in your `home` directory, located at `///<username>/home/` although you can change it to any location you want (this feature is currently a request)

On BSD, data is placed in your `home` directory, located at `///<username>/home/` although you can change it to any location you want (this feature is currently a request)

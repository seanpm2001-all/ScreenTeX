# Feature requests

## Alternative screenshot shortcut

An option to save the text and the screenshot is coming soon, and will supercede the `ALT` + `P` + `F10` shortcut. Users will be able to choose between the `ALT` + `P` + `F10` shortcut, or the merged functionality with the `F10 (Print Screen)` key.

The merged functionality with the `F10` key (or `FN` + `F10` keys) will allow the export of both an image and a data file at the same time, although you can disable one or the other.

## Ability to switch save location

The ability to switch the location where exports are saved is planned for Windows NT, MacOS, Linux, and BSD.
